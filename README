RESEARCH EVALUTION CODE -- NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION USE
======================================

This is the companion code to the research paper
    "Ensuring High-Quality Randomness in Cryptographic Key Generation"
by
    Henry Corrigan-Gibbs (Stanford)
    Wendy Mu (Stanford)
    Dan Boneh (Stanford)
    Bryan Ford (Yale)
published in the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2013.

The paper is available online for free here:

======================================

This is research prototype code which we build for the sole purpose of testing
out our new algorithm. This code is not well documented, not beautifully
written, not easy to compile on different platforms (probably), and definitely
not "secure" (for any definition of "secure").

The code is here so that if you do want to implement our system properly,
you have a good idea of where to start. If you would like to point out
mistakes or potential areas of improvement, please feel free to email us.
You can find our contact information online.

======================================

Running "make" should make three binaries.

main      -  plays the role of the device generating keys
ca_server - plays the role of the certificate authority
ea_server - plays the role of the entropy authority
